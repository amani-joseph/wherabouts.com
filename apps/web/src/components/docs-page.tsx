											a managed-key proxy flow. You choose one of your active
											keys and the explorer sends the request server-side
											without requiring you to paste the raw secret.

											If you need to validate a specific bearer token manually,
											the explorer also supports a raw-key mode. Raw keys are
											kept only for the current browser session and are never
											persisted by the explorer.

											Every explorer request is labeled as `Test traffic`, so it
