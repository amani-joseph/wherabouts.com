# Platform Milestones: Wherabouts API Platform

## Purpose

This document breaks the strategic platform roadmap into executable milestone units that can later be converted into tactical roadmap items, phase plans, and implementation work.

## Milestone Format

Each milestone should be executable as a vertical slice:

- one user-visible or platform-visible outcome
- clear repo areas touched
- measurable completion criteria
- obvious strategic phase alignment
- explicit strategic requirement ID mapping

## Phase 1 Milestones: Core API and Developer Foundation

- Strategic requirements advanced:
  - `P3-R01`
  - `P3-R05`
- Completion criteria:
  - usage analytics exist
  - request inspection exists
  - customers can understand current consumption

### M9. Billing, limits, and spend controls

  - `P3-R03`
  - `P3-R05`
- Completion criteria:
  - batch geocoding exists
  - batch validation exists
  - webhooks are configurable and observable

### M11. Ecosystem reach

- Outcome: the platform reaches more developers through frameworks, integrations, and community touchpoints
- Strategic requirements advanced:
  - `P3-R04`
- Completion criteria:
  - additional framework bindings exist
  - at least one meaningful no-code or commerce integration exists
  - community support channels are established

## Phase 4 Milestones: Intelligence, Scale and Enterprise

  - partner motion exists
  - developer education and certification path exists
  - selected platform assets are reusable and promotable

## Recommended Conversion Path

Convert milestones into tactical execution in this order:

1. Phase 1 milestones first, starting with M2 and M3 because they align most closely with the current repo state.
2. Use the existing `apps/web/.planning/ROADMAP.md` as the short-horizon execution track.
3. When a tactical roadmap item is created, annotate which platform milestone and strategic requirement IDs it advances.

## Immediate Next Milestones for This Repo

- M2. Auth and developer access foundation
- M3. Developer portal and reference experience
- M1. Core endpoint contract stabilization

Those three milestones are the best bridge from the current codebase to the strategic roadmap.
