# Phase 06 Plan 02: Wrangler Config Alignment Summary

Aligned both wrangler configs with mydeffo.com-web patterns: added structured observability logging with invocation_logs, production environment block with custom domain routing, and @cloudflare/workers-types for server TypeScript support.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Key Changes |
|---|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Add observability and production env to wrangler configs | 09fc22b | Added observability.logs block to both configs; added env.production with custom domain to server |
| 2 | Add @cloudflare/workers-types to apps/server | cf64302 | Added devDependency for Cloudflare Workers type definitions |

## Key Changes

### apps/web/wrangler.jsonc
- Added `observability` block with `logs.enabled`, `logs.invocation_logs`, `head_sampling_rate: 1`
- Updated default vars to workers.dev URLs (production URLs belong in env.production)

### apps/server/wrangler.jsonc
- Restructured flat `head_sampling_rate` into nested `observability.logs` object matching mydeffo pattern
- Added `env.production` block with `AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, production `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `WEB_BASE_URL`
- Added `env.production.routes` with `api.wherabouts.com` custom domain
- Updated default vars to workers.dev URLs

### apps/server/package.json
- Added `@cloudflare/workers-types` as devDependency for Workers runtime type definitions
