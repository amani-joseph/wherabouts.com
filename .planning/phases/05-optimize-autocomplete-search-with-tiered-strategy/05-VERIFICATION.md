# Phase 5: Optimize Autocomplete Search with Tiered Strategy Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Autocomplete returns ranked, relevant results in <100ms using tiered search (prefix, trigram, fuzzy, phonetic) with population/proximity boosting -- no Elasticsearch
**Verified:** 2026-04-15T09:00:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No -- initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | pg_trgm and fuzzystrmatch extensions enabled in PostgreSQL | VERIFIED | Migration `0009_tiered_search_extensions.sql` lines 1,3: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` and `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS fuzzystrmatch` |
| 2 | Queries 3-4 chars use fast prefix search, 5+ use trigram+fuzzy, 8+ widen fuzzy tolerance | VERIFIED | `autocomplete.ts` lines 192-209 (Tier 1: prefix LIKE), 211-253 (Tier 2: trigram % + levenshtein<=1), 255-314 (Tier 3: word_similarity <%% + levenshtein<=2) |
| 3 | Results ranked by population score, admin level, similarity, and optional proximity | VERIFIED | `buildOrderBy()` lines 107-128: `population_score DESC, admin_level ASC` + optional `ST_Distance` + `similarity_score DESC` |
| 4 | Phonetic fallback (dmetaphone) fires when fuzzy returns zero results for 8+ char queries | VERIFIED | `autocomplete.ts` lines 298-314: dmetaphone phonetic fallback after levenshtein returns 0 rows in Tier 3 |
| 5 | API accepts optional lat/lon for proximity boosting | VERIFIED | `autocomplete.ts` (API route) lines 18-21: `lat`/`lon` parsed, lines 30-56: validation, lines 58-64: passed to `autocompleteAddresses` |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `packages/database/drizzle/0009_tiered_search_extensions.sql` | Migration enabling pg_trgm, fuzzystrmatch, adding columns and indexes | VERIFIED | 13 lines, contains all 6 SQL statements with statement-breakpoint separators |
| `packages/database/src/schema/addresses.ts` | Updated Drizzle schema with populationScore, adminLevel | VERIFIED | Lines 41-42: `populationScore` and `adminLevel` with correct defaults |
| `packages/database/src/queries/autocomplete.ts` | Tiered autocomplete query with prefix, trigram, fuzzy, phonetic layers | VERIFIED | 316 lines, exports `autocompleteAddresses`, implements all 4 tiers |
| `apps/web/src/routes/api/v1/addresses/autocomplete.ts` | Updated API endpoint with lat/lon support | VERIFIED | 70 lines, parses lat/lon, validates coordinates, passes to query function |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `autocomplete.ts` (query) | `addresses.ts` (schema) | Uses `population_score`, `admin_level` in SQL | WIRED | `buildOrderBy()` references `population_score DESC, admin_level ASC` |
| `autocomplete.ts` (API route) | `autocomplete.ts` (query) | Imports and calls `autocompleteAddresses` with latitude/longitude | WIRED | Line 2: `import { autocompleteAddresses } from "@wherabouts.com/database/queries"`, line 58-64: passes lat/lon in options |
| `queries/index.ts` | `autocomplete.ts` (query) | Re-exports `autocompleteAddresses` | WIRED | Line 2: `export { autocompleteAddresses } from "./autocomplete.ts"` |
| `package.json` | `queries/index.ts` | Package exports `./queries` entry | WIRED | Line 9: `"./queries": "./src/queries/index.ts"` |

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

Not applicable -- this phase implements a database query function and API endpoint. No UI components render dynamic data. The data flow is: API request -> query params -> SQL query -> database -> response JSON. The SQL queries use parameterized values against real database tables (not static/hardcoded data).

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

Step 7b: SKIPPED (requires running database server with pg_trgm/fuzzystrmatch extensions and populated addresses table -- cannot verify without live Neon PostgreSQL connection)

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SEARCH-01 | 05-01 | pg_trgm extension enabled | SATISFIED | Migration line 1: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` |
| SEARCH-02 | 05-01 | fuzzystrmatch extension enabled, population_score/admin_level columns and indexes | SATISFIED | Migration lines 3-13: extension + columns + indexes; Schema lines 41-42 |
| SEARCH-03 | 05-02 | Tiered search dispatch based on query length | SATISFIED | autocomplete.ts: Tier 0 (<3), Tier 1 (3-4), Tier 2 (5-7), Tier 3 (8+) |
| SEARCH-04 | 05-02 | Results ranked by population, admin level, similarity | SATISFIED | buildOrderBy: `population_score DESC, admin_level ASC, similarity_score DESC` |
| SEARCH-05 | 05-02 | Phonetic fallback for 8+ char queries | SATISFIED | Lines 298-314: dmetaphone fallback after levenshtein returns empty |
| SEARCH-06 | 05-03 | API accepts lat/lon for proximity boosting | SATISFIED | API route: lat/lon parsing, validation, forwarding to query function |

No orphaned requirements found. All 6 SEARCH-* requirements from ROADMAP.md are claimed by plans and verified.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | - | - | - | No anti-patterns detected |

No TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, console.log statements, or empty implementations found in any phase files.

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Tiered Search Performance Under Load

**Test:** Run autocomplete queries against production Neon database with 60M+ rows: test "syd" (3 chars), "sydne" (5 chars), "sydneyyy" (8 chars misspelling)
**Expected:** All queries return in <100ms; prefix returns Sydney addresses; trigram handles partial matches; phonetic catches misspellings
**Why human:** Requires live database with pg_trgm/fuzzystrmatch extensions and populated data to verify real-world latency

### 2. Migration Execution on Neon

**Test:** Run `0009_tiered_search_extensions.sql` against the Neon PostgreSQL instance
**Expected:** Extensions created, columns added, indexes built without errors
**Why human:** CONCURRENTLY index creation and extension enabling require superuser or rds_superuser privileges that vary by Neon plan

### 3. Proximity Boosting Accuracy

**Test:** Query "pizza" with lat/lon near Sydney CBD vs lat/lon near Melbourne CBD
**Expected:** Results near the provided coordinates rank higher
**Why human:** Requires populated data with geographic distribution to verify ST_Distance ordering works correctly

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 5 observable truths verified. All 4 artifacts exist, are substantive (not stubs), and are properly wired through the import chain from package exports to API route handler. All 6 SEARCH-* requirements are satisfied. No anti-patterns detected.

The phase delivers a complete tiered autocomplete search implementation: database infrastructure (extensions, columns, indexes), query logic (4-tier dispatch with fallback chains), and API surface (lat/lon proximity parameters with validation). The only items requiring human verification are live database execution and performance validation.
