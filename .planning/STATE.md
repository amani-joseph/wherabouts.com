# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

**Core value:** Users can authenticate seamlessly -- login, signup, OAuth, and session persistence must work without disruption after the migration.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — Teams — creation, invitations, API keys

## Current Position

Phase: 08 (Teams — creation, invitations, API keys) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 7

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3 phases (coarse granularity) -- Infrastructure, Auth Flows, Legacy Auth Removal
- [Roadmap]: Reference mydeffo.com-web for BetterAuth patterns during Phase 1 planning
- [Phase 01]: router.invalidate() before navigate() for post-auth redirect to update isAuthenticated context
- [Phase 04]: Inline endpoint config and auth constants in api-explorer.ts to avoid cross-package imports from apps/web
- [Phase 04]: Use Awaited<ReturnType<...>> for type inference from orpcClient instead of duplicating interfaces
- [Phase 05]: Hand-written migrations for indexes requiring operator classes (text_pattern_ops) since Drizzle cannot express them
- [Phase 05]: Used Drizzle sql template literals for raw SQL since trigram operators cannot be expressed in query builder
- [Phase 06]: Use dotenv/config side-effect import for Worker-compatible env loading
- [Phase 06]: Replaced crossSubDomainCookies with defaultCookieAttributes for explicit cookie domain control via AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN env var
- [Phase 08]: text (not uuid) for userId/invitedBy in team tables — matches users.id text PK in auth.ts
- [Phase 08]: uq_projects_user_slug kept alongside uq_projects_team_slug in Plan 01 — Plan 02 drops old index after backfill

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 4 added: Implement APIs using oRPC with mutations and procedures
- Phase 5 added: Optimize autocomplete search with tiered strategy
- Phase 6 added: Mirror Cloudflare deployment configurations from mydeffo.com-web
- Phase 7 adopted: Extract auth into its own package (pre-drafted research + 3 plans in 07-extract-auth-into-its-own-package/, now formally in roadmap)
- Phase 8 added: Teams — creation, email invitations (Resend), and auto-generated per-member API keys scoped to the team (renumbered from 7 due to phase 7 adoption)

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
