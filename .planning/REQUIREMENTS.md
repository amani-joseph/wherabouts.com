# Requirements: Wherabouts.com — BetterAuth Migration

**Defined:** 2026-04-14
**Core Value:** Users can authenticate seamlessly — login, signup, OAuth, and session persistence must work without disruption after the migration.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for the migration. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Authentication

- [ ] **AUTH-01**: User can create account with email and password
- [ ] **AUTH-02**: User receives email verification after signup
- [ ] **AUTH-03**: User can reset password via email link
- [ ] **AUTH-04**: User session persists across browser refresh

### OAuth

- [ ] **OATH-01**: User can sign in with Google OAuth
- [ ] **OATH-02**: User can sign in with GitHub OAuth

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **INFR-01**: BetterAuth server configured for TanStack Start
- [ ] **INFR-02**: Convex adapter stores users and sessions
- [ ] **INFR-03**: Auth middleware protects routes requiring authentication
- [ ] **INFR-04**: Client-side auth hooks provide current user and auth state

### Migration

- [ ] **MIGR-01**: All legacy auth packages and dependencies removed
- [ ] **MIGR-02**: All legacy auth middleware, components, and API routes removed
- [ ] **MIGR-03**: All legacy auth environment variables removed
- [ ] **MIGR-04**: User profile/metadata accessible via BetterAuth

### oRPC API Layer

- [x] **ORPC-01**: API explorer requests execute through oRPC procedure instead of createServerFn
- [x] **ORPC-02**: TanStack Query utils wired up via createTanstackQueryUtils for cache key management
- [x] **ORPC-03**: All data fetching uses orpcClient directly (no thin wrapper files)
- [x] **ORPC-04**: Only one justified createServerFn remains (fetchSession in __root.tsx for SSR)

### Cloudflare Deployment

- [ ] **CFDP-01**: Server env module uses Worker-compatible env loading (no node:fs/node:path)
- [ ] **CFDP-02**: Wrangler configs have observability logging enabled for both apps
- [ ] **CFDP-03**: apps/server has production environment block with custom domain and production vars
- [ ] **CFDP-04**: Dead/unnecessary dependencies removed from apps/web (next, postcss tooling, etc.)
- [ ] **CFDP-05**: Auth cookie domain configurable via env var for cross-subdomain deployment

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Additional Auth

- **AAUTH-01**: User can sign in with Apple Sign In
- **AAUTH-02**: User can enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
- **AAUTH-03**: Magic link passwordless login

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Apple Sign In | Not currently used, can add later |
| Multi-tenancy / organizations | Not part of current auth setup |
| Automated user data migration tooling | Manual migration if needed |
| Additional OAuth providers beyond Google/GitHub | Defer to future |
| 2FA | Not currently implemented |

## Traceability

| AUTH-01 | Phase 2 | Pending |
| AUTH-02 | Phase 2 | Pending |
