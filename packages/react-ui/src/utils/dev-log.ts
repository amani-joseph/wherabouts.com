/**
 * Log an unexpected error to the console in development.
 *
 * The data-fetching hooks catch errors and surface them only as a localized
 * error state in the UI. That makes genuinely unexpected failures — a
 * misconfigured client, a network/CORS problem, or the SDK throwing before a
 * request is even sent — nearly invisible to developers.
 *
 * This logs such errors loudly during development and no-ops in production. It
 * deliberately skips `AbortError` (an expected outcome of cancelled requests)
 * so the console isn't flooded by normal cancellations.
