## Usage beyond your plan

> No hard cutoffs that break your app, no mystery multipliers. Go over and you pay simple, published AUD rates — or upgrade any time.

| What | Overage rate (AUD) |
|---|---|
| Geocoding / regions / routing requests | **$0.60** per 1,000 |
| Geofence / webhook events | **$0.50** per 1,000 |
| Additional tracked device | **$0.50** per device / month |

*The Free tier hard-stops at its limit (we email you well before) — so a free project can never generate a bill.*

---

## Launch offers (limited)

- **🪧 Founding customers:** the first 20 paying accounts lock in **30% off for life.**
- **🗓️ Annual billing:** pay yearly, get **2 months free** (~16% off).
- **❤️ Charities & open civic projects:** free — [tell us what you're building].

---

## Why metered this way?

We charge a low, transparent rate for commodity geocoding, and meter the **real-time geofencing layer** (devices + events) separately — because that's the part nobody else in Australia offers, and it's where your usage actually grows. You're never paying enterprise rates to look up an address.

## FAQ

**Is there really a free tier?**
Yes — 10,000 requests every month, forever, no credit card. It hard-stops at the limit so a free project can never run up a bill.

**What counts as a "request"?**
One API call to a geocoding, autocomplete, region, or routing endpoint. Geofence/webhook *events* are metered separately (see overage table).

**What's a "device" and an "event"?**
A *device* is a tracked entity whose location you push to us (a driver, vehicle, asset). An *event* is a zone enter/exit we detect and deliver via webhook.

**Can I change plans anytime?**
Yes — upgrade, downgrade, or cancel from the dashboard. Changes are prorated. No contracts.

**Do you charge in USD?**
No. Everything is AUD, including overage. No FX surprises on your invoice.

**What happens if I exceed my plan?**
On paid plans you keep working and pay the published per-1k overage, or upgrade for a better rate. On Free, you hard-stop until the next month (we warn you first).

**Where is my data hosted?**
In Australia. Data residency and a DPA are available on Enterprise.

**Do you offer discounts?**
Annual billing (2 months free), a founding-customer lifetime discount for the first 20 accounts, and free access for charities and open civic projects.

**Which data do you use?**
G-NAF (Geoscape's authoritative AU address file) and ABS ASGS boundaries — official Australian government data, kept current with each release.

**Can I self-host?**
The hosted API is the product. Enterprise customers with residency or air-gap needs can talk to us about options.
